# rock_weather

A basic weather forecast telemetry app that seeks to implement proper Clean Code architecture in Flutter following SOLID patterns.

Contains a home screen with current weather information for 4 of the following cities:

* Silverstone, UK
* Melbourne, AU
* SÃ£o Paulo, BR
* Monte Carlo, MO

Each weather information can be expanded for a detailed forecast of the next 5 days, containing weather information on an interval of 3 hours.

The app uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) to request weather information, on each request the app caches the weather data to local storage for offline use.

## Setup

Download and install the apk file on your Android device.
